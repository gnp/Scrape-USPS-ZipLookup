CHANGES

2.6 [2012-03-17]

Project is now hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/gnp/Scrape-USPS-ZipLookup

  * Migrate to LWP::UserAgent from WWW::Mechanize because what we are doing really is
    pretty simple.

  * Migrate from regexp-based parsing of output to using HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath to
    parse the HTML and XML::XPathEngine to extract 

  * Add a new 'Commercial Mail Receiving Facility' attribute to Address and the parsing,
    to match what is presently on the USPS web site.

  * Copyright date updates

NOTE: The support for 'firm' in addresses is looking like it really doesn't work. I've
not deleted it but am considering doing so. I tried making a unit test that exercised
it but was not able to get the test working in a reasonable amount of time for this
release.


2.5 [2006-07-04]

  * Remove outdated test.html file.

  * Removed dead code

  * Added a test case for multiple returned addresses

  * More detailed "Mailing Industry Information" parsing

  * More adaptations to the USPS Zip Lookup web site.

  Thanks to the following people for bug reports and code suggestions (whether
  I used them or not): Olaf Alders <olaf@wundersolutions.com>,
  Adam Anderson <adam@makeascene.com>, jbwaters@gmail.com,
  James 'J.C.' Jones <jcjones@ufl.edu>, Jonathan Kamens <jik@kamens.brookline.ma.us>,
  Jann Linder <jannlinder@gmail.com>, David Simmons <simmons@davidsimmons.com>

2.4 [2005-09-20]

  * Adapt to yet another round of changes to the USPS Zip Lookup
    web site, courtesy of Eric Parker <ercparker@mac.com>.

  * Copyright date updates.


2.3 [2004-10-15]

  * Be a little more flexible about zip code format, per an email
    from Michael S. Muegel <mike@muegel.org> (although the example
    he gave of an adress returning XXXXX-YY where XXXXX was a good
    looking zip code but YY was some oddball text like "ND" didn't
    work that way for me).

  * Adapted to latest USPS changes, including new welcome page URL
    and new format of results. RT ticket submitted 2004-09-28 by
    <rayvd@bludgeon.org>, and email notice to me from:

      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=7804

    Also reported by Chris Johnson <cjohnson@corp.digitalpath.net>
    and John Baker <johnb@listbrokers.com> via personal emails on
    2004-09-28.


2.2 [2004-07-02]

  * Updated start URL for first page fetch to match new operation of
    USPS site.

  * Updated the form ID used to refer to the form, since the site has
    been changed to use a named form

  * Now under verbose output, you get to the the result of fetching
    the start URL.

  * Copyright date updates.

  * NOTE: It appears that the service is *significantly slower than
    it used to be. This may be on purpose to dissuade you from using
    the service inappropriately. Consider this a reminder that you
    should not be using this module for purposes not allowed by the
    USPS usage policy posted on their site.


2.1 [2003-12-15]

  * Fixed documentation's sample program

  * Prevent a warning about a filehandle being used only once (when
    in reality it isn't).


2.0 [2003-12-13]

  * Works with recently changed USPS web site.

  * Uses WWW::Mechanize to interact with the USPS web application.

  * New script/stdaddr program to demonstrate usage.

  * New test.html HTML file to show minimal interaction with the USPS
    application.


1.1 [2002-07-13]

  * Now uses usps.com instead of usps.gov.

  * Fixed a documentation markup bug related to turning on debuggin.

  * Fixed a documentation bug in Scrape::USPS::ZipLookup regarding
    how to call verbose().

  * Fixed Scrape::USPS::ZipLookup::Address' logic to use isa().

  * Fixed one of the standardize.t tests.


1.0

  * Renamed to Scrape::USPS::ZipLookup from Data::Address::Standardize.
    (based on version 0.003 of Data::Address::Standardize).
