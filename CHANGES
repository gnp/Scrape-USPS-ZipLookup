CHANGES


2.3.1 [2005-09-19]

  * Adapt to yet another round of changes to the USPS Zip Lookup
    web site, courtesy of Eric Parker <ercparker@mac.com>.

  * Copyright date updates.


2.3 [2004-10-15]

  * Be a little more flexible about zip code format, per an email
    from Michael S. Muegel <mike@muegel.org> (although the example
    he gave of an adress returning XXXXX-YY where XXXXX was a good
    looking zip code but YY was some oddball text like "ND" didn't
    work that way for me).

  * Adapted to latest USPS changes, including new welcome page URL
    and new format of results. RT ticket submitted 2004-09-28 by
    <rayvd@bludgeon.org>, and email notice to me from:

      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=7804

    Also reported by Chris Johnson <cjohnson@corp.digitalpath.net>
    and John Baker <johnb@listbrokers.com> via personal emails on
    2004-09-28.


2.2 [2004-07-02]

  * Updated start URL for first page fetch to match new operation of
    USPS site.

  * Updated the form ID used to refer to the form, since the site has
    been changed to use a named form

  * Now under verbose output, you get to the the result of fetching
    the start URL.

  * Copyright date updates.

  * NOTE: It appears that the service is *significantly slower than
    it used to be. This may be on purpose to dissuade you from using
    the service inappropriately. Consider this a reminder that you
    should not be using this module for purposes not allowed by the
    USPS usage policy posted on their site.
