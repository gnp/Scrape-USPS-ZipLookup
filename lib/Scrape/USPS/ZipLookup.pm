=head1 DESCRIPTION

The United States Postal Service (USPS) has on its web site an HTML form at
C<http://www.usps.com/zip4/>
for standardizing an address. Given a firm, urbanization, street address,
city, state, and zip, it will put the address into standard form (provided
the address is in their database) and display a page with the resulting
address.

This Perl module provides a programmatic interface to this service, so you
can write a program to process your entire personal address book without
having to manually type them all in to the form.

Because the USPS could change or remove this functionality at any time,
be prepared for the possibility that this code may fail to function. In
fact, as of this version, there is no error checking in place, so if they
do change things, this code will most likely fail in a noisy way. If you
discover that the service has changed, please email the author your findings.

If an error occurs in trying to standardize the address, then no array
will be returned. Otherwise, a four-element array will be returned.

To see debugging output, call C<< $zlu->verbose(1) >>.

these terms, but sole responsibility for conforming to the terms of use
