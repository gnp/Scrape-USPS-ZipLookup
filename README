DESCRIPTION
    The United States Postal Service (USPS) has on its web site an HTML form
    at "http://www.usps.com/zip4/" for standardizing an address. Given a
    firm, urbanization, street address, city, state, and zip, it will put
    the address into standard form (provided the address is in their
    database) and display a page with the resulting address.

    This Perl module provides a programmatic interface to this service, so
    you can write a program to process your entire personal address book
    without having to manually type them all in to the form.

    Because the USPS could change or remove this functionality at any time,
    be prepared for the possibility that this code may fail to function. In
    fact, as of this version, there is no error checking in place, so if
    they do change things, this code will most likely fail in a noisy way.
    If you discover that the service has changed, please email the author
    your findings.

    If an error occurs in trying to standardize the address, then no array
    will be returned. Otherwise, a four-element array will be returned.

    To see debugging output, call "$zlu->verbose(1)".
